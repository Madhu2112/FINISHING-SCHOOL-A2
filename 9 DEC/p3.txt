Given an matrix with no duplicate values, return all lucky numbers in the
matrix.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that, it is the maximum element in its row and minimum in its column.

ex:
input =
3 3
3 7 8
9 11 13
15 16 17
output =8
explanantion: 8 is the only lucky number since it is the maximum number in row and minimum in its column.


ex2:
input =
3
4
15 16 17 12
9 3 8 7
1 10 4 2
output =-1
none of the elements in the matrix matches the luckynumber rules. so print -1.

input =
2 2
1 2
7 8
output =2
explanantion: 2 is the only lucky number since it is the maximum number in row and minimum in its column.
